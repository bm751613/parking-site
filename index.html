            <p>All great cities have parks, and Athens is missing them. Try imagining Manhattan without Central Park; the city grows cold and lifeless despite the millions of people walking around. Without Central Park where do New Yorkers play football? Where do the Jazz players practice, and children learn to ice skate?</p>
            <p>Public spaces are important, they’re where a city sees itself, and where we understand its identity and our place in it. Greater Athens is surrounded by those places, but is missing them in the heart of its city. </p>
            <p>Despite how big a city is the citizens always create the culture, they decide what buildings will be built, where parks will be laid, and where money is spent. We need to preserve Athens’s  smallness, its uniqueness and its essence. We need to make sure our city doesn't become one of the many American suburban town centers with carbon copy plaza’s and a Panera Bread.</p>
            <p>In 2013, Athens Mayor Paul Wiehl and City Planner, Paul Logue began an outreach program that challenged community members to define what Athens is, not what they liked or thought it should be. A year later, The Essence of Athens was published, a book filled with hundreds of ideas that form a picture of the unusual, quirky and gorgeous city we love. The book helps us understand our city and preserve its essence. As our city grows, and our ideas grow larger, we will look back to books like these, which help us stop and think for a moment, “is this our city?”</p>
